h3. Discussion

Essentially, depending on an established UI framework can have it's limitations - especially as it relates to agile.

* custom behavior can be time-consuming to build
* in the long run, would it have been easier to build your own UI components - not all of them, but key ones especially
* how well must designers understand the platforms they are targetting
* how do we stay agile with respect to the general UI design
* wireframes vs final mocks
* estimations in a business world
* enterprise products, not so custom
* creative products, custom controls yeah!
* style guides
* UI vs UX
* graphic design vs workflow
* agile dodging, positioning body correctly to be able to pivot
* are we positioning ourselves if we commit to UIKit
* while the Apple frameworks are well supported, they were built up by people just like you and I with, for the most part, the same access we have to the underlying SDK
* learning how to build these up ourselves
